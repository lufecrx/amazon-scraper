# Amazon Product Scraper

This is an Amazon product scraping application developed as part of an internship task.

## Setup and Execution

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-scraper.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Node.js server: `node server.js`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application page.

## Documentation

- The backend is built with Node.js, Express, Axios, and JSDOM. It provides an `/api/scrape` endpoint that accepts keyword queries to perform scraping of Amazon search results.
- The frontend consists of an HTML page, a CSS style file, and a JavaScript script. It allows users to input a keyword, initiate the scraping process, and view the results on the page.

## Considerations

- The code is written cleanly and well-commented for easy understanding.
- Errors are handled appropriately both in the backend and frontend for a smooth user experience.
